This is the observer design pattern in action,a thread notifying another thread when to execute depending on the bussiness logic in the program.
Here in this example, an AND gate is constructed using the signal class,and each time a signal changes it value (from 0 to 1 for example) , 
the AND gate will receive the respone and change its output
